# MBH Structures

Mbh structures contains an abstraction of many of the structures used throughout the development of the framework, giving the possibility of being used by any other developer as a mini library of data structures.

## Collections

Immutable collections, with filter, map, join, sort, slice, and other methods. Well-suited for functional programming and memory-intensive applications. Runs especially fast in PHP 7.

You can read the following [file](./docs/COLLECTIONS.md) to learn how the structure works.

## Install

structures is available on composer via packagist.

```sh
composer require mbh-framework/structures
```
